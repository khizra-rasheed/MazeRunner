# MazeRunner
This is my personal project and the inspiration was taken from the movie MazeRunner. In this a different 8*8 maze is generated everytime and the pawn tries to find the optimal way out of it.
-> it is developed using unreal engine version 5.1
-> it is blueprint based
Key Components used:
-> Navigation system
-> AI character to navigate through the maze.
-> 3D vector math to create a different mazr everytime.
